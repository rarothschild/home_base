            Bazaar Market is a fully operational web application that integrates a Django-powered
            backend with a modern SvelteKit frontend, styled comprehensively with Tailwind CSS and
            supported by a PostgreSQL database. The platform orchestrates product catalogs, user
            accounts, and transactional workflows through Django views and REST-style endpoints,
            which expose structured JSON responses that are consumed by SvelteKit routes and
            components. Tailwind utility classes are applied throughout to maintain a consistent,
            responsive design system while allowing fine-grained control over layout, typography,
            and interactive states.

            Persistent data is managed on Heroku using a hosted PostgreSQL instance, where
            schema migrations are administered via Django's migration framework and operational
            observability is assisted by the Heroku dashboard. Core business entities—such as
            products, orders, and customer profiles—are stored in normalized relational tables and
            queried using parameterized SQL generated through Django's ORM layer. This approach
            ensures that complex filtering, aggregation, and transactional consistency are handled
            efficiently, while still allowing hand-tuned SQL queries where necessary for performance
            or reporting. Together, these technologies provide a cohesive, production-ready stack
            for delivering a robust online marketplace experience.
