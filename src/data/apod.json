{"date":"2025-07-06","explanation":"Why is there a spiral around the North Pole of Mars?  Each winter this pole develops a new outer layer about one meter thick composed of carbon dioxide frozen out of the thin Martian atmosphere.  This fresh layer is deposited on a water-ice layer that exists year round.  Strong winds blow down from above the cap's center and swirl due to the spin of the red planet -- contributing to Planum Boreum's spiral structure.  The featured image is a perspective mosaic generated in 2017 from numerous images taken by ESA's Mars Express and elevations extracted from the laser altimeter aboard NASA's Mars Global Surveyor mission.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MarsNorthPole_MarsExpress_960.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Spiral North Pole of Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MarsNorthPole_MarsExpress_960.jpg"}
