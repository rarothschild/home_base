First, far in the distance, the majestic band of our Milky Way Galaxy runs down the left. Mirroring it on the right are several parallel trails of Earth-orbiting Starlink satellites. Many fainter satellite trails also crisscross the image. The two short and bright streaks are meteors \u2014 likely members of the annual Eta Aquariids meteor shower.
