Last Monday, the photogenic launch plume from a SpaceX rocket launch created quite a spectacle over parts of southern California and Arizona.  Looking at times like a giant space fish, the impressive rocket launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc, California, was so bright because it was backlit by the setting Sun. The Falcon 9 rocket successfully delivered to low Earth orbit 23 Starlink communications satellites.  The plume from the first stage is seen on the right, while the soaring upper stage rocket is seen at the apex of the plume toward the left. Venus appears at the top of the frame, while a bright streetlight shines on the far right.  The featured image was captured toward the west after sunset from near Phoenix, Arizona.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/FishPlume_LaMontagne_2272.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"SpaceX Rocket Launch Plume over California","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/FishPlume_LaMontagne_960.jpg"}
