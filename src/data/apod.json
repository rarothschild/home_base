The wintry scene was captured from southern Poland on the northern hemisphere's long solstice night. Otherwise unseen nebulae hang in the sky, revealed by the camera modified to record red hydrogen-alpha light. The nebulae lie near the edge of the Orion molecular cloud and join the Hunter's familiar belt stars and bright giants Betelgeuse and Rigel. Eye of Taurus the Bull, yellowish Aldebaran anchors the V-shaped Hyades star cluster near top center. Still, near opposition in planet Earth's sky, the Solar System's ruling gas giant Jupiter is the brightest celestial beacon above this horizon's snowy peaks.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/bubak-poland.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A December Winter Night","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/bubak-poland1024.jpg"}
