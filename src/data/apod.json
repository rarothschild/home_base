And the high level of solar activity should extend into 2026. So, while you're celebrating the arrival of the new year, check out this spectacular auroral display that erupted in starry night skies over Kirkjufell, Iceland.

This northland and skyscape captures the evocative display in a 21 frame panoramic mosaic.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2601/AuroraFireworksstormRoiLevi.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Auroral Corona","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2601/AuroraFireworksstormRoiLevi1024.jpg"}
