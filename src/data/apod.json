To begin, a ring that's near NGC 1512's center -- and so hard to see here -- is the nuclear ring which glows brightly with recently formed stars.  Next out is a ring of stars and dust appearing both red and blue, called, counter-intuitively, the inner ring.  This inner ring connects ends of a diffuse central bar of stars that runs horizontally across the galaxy.  Farthest out in this wide field image is a ragged structure that might be considered an outer ring. This outer ring appears spiral-like and is dotted with clusters of bright blue stars.  All these ring structures are thought to be affected by NGC 1512's own gravitational asymmetries in a drawn-out process called secular evolution.  The featured image was captured last month from a telescope at Deep Sky Chile in Chile.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2602/NGC1512_stern_6214.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Spiral Galaxy NGC 1512: Wide Field","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2602/NGC1512_stern_960.jpg"}
