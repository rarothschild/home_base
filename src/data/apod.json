{"date":"2025-06-09","explanation":"Can you identify this celestial object?  Likely not \u2014 because this is a discovery image.  Massive stars forge heavy elements in their cores and, after a few million years, end their lives in powerful supernova explosions. These remnants cool relatively quickly and fade, making them difficult to detect.  To uncover such faint, previously unknown supernova remnants, a dedicated group of amateur astrophotographers searched through sky surveys for possible supernova remnant candidates.  The result: the first-ever image of supernova remnant G115.5+9.1 \u2014 named Scylla by its discoverers\u2014glowing faintly in the constellation of the mythological King of Aethiopia: Cepheus.  Emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red, and faint emission from oxygen is shown in hues of blue.  Surprisingly, another discovery lurked to the upper right: a faint, previously unknown planetary nebula candidate. In keeping with mythological tradition, it was named Charybdis (Sai 2) \u2014 a nod to the ancient Greek expression \"caught between Scylla and Charybdis\" from Homer\u2019s Odyssey.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ScyllaB_LerouxGere_2094.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Between Scylla and Charybdis: A Double Cosmic Discovery","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ScyllaB_LerouxGere_960.jpg"}
