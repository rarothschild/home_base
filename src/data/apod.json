The Egg Nebula, a dying Sun-like star, can unscramble this question.  Pictured is a combination of several visible and infrared images of the nebula (also known as RAFGL 2688 or CRL 2688) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.  The star has shed its outer layers, and a bright, hot core (or \"yolk\") now illuminates the milky \"egg white\" shells of gas and dust surrounding the center.  The central lobes and rings are structures of gas and dust recently ejected into space, with the dust being dense enough to block our view of the stellar core.  Light beams emanate from that blocked core, escaping through holes carved in the older ejected material by newer, faster jets expelled from the star\u2019s poles.  Astronomers are still trying to figure out what causes the disks, lobes, and jets during this short (only a few thousand years!) phase of the star\u2019s evolution, making this an egg-cellent image to study!","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2602/Egg_Hubble_2048.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Egg Nebula from the Hubble Telescope","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2602/Egg_Hubble_960.jpg"}
