{"date":"2025-02-07","explanation":"The giant galaxy cataloged as LEDA 1313424 is about two and a half times the size of our own Milky Way. Its remarkable appearance in this recently released Hubble Space Telescope image strongly suggests its nickname \"The Bullseye Galaxy\". Known as a collisional ring galaxy it has nine rings confirmed by telescopic observations, rippling from its center like waves from a pebble dropped into a pond. Of course, the pebble dropped into the Bullseye galaxy was a galaxy itself. Telescopic observations identify the blue dwarf galaxy at center-left as the likely collider, passing through the giant galaxy's center and forming concentric rings in the wake of their gravitational interaction. The Bullseye Galaxy lies some 567 million light-years away toward the constellation Pisces. At that distance, this stunning Hubble image would span about 530,000 light-years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/Hubble_LEDA1313424_STScI-01.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"LEDA 1313424: The Bullseye Galaxy","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/Hubble_LEDA1313424_STScI-01_1024.jpg"}
